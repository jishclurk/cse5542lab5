*** How to use the program***

The program can be used by opening the "lab-3.html" file in a web browser. Once the page is loaded,
you should see a scene that you can interact with. For this lab, the heirarchical tranformations are 
done using the limbs of the person in the scene. You can select the part of the person you wish to 
focus on, and then rotate that part and any parts dependent on it using the mouse or keyboard. You 
can also change the location and intensity of the light within the scene. The following
are the keyboard and mouse controls for the program:

	- Click and hold the left mouse button and move the cursor left/right to rotate the whole scene about the Y-axis
	- Click and hold the right mouse button and move the cursor up/down to scale the whole scene
        - Press f to move the person upz
        - Press b to move the person down
        - Press l to move the person to the left
        - Press r to move the person to the right
        - Press c to rotate the selected part clockwise around the Y-axis
	- Press v to rotate the selected part counter-clockwise around the Y-axis
	- Press x to rotate the selected part clockwise around the Z-axis
        - Press z to rotate the selected part counter-clockwise around the Z-axis
        - Press s to make the person larger
        - Press d to make the person smaller

In addition to these controls, you can use the HTML buttons below the WebGL canvas in order to move the position of the Camera and 
the Center of Interest (COI), the rotation (head tilt/pan/roll) of the camera, and the world space position and intensity of the light in the scene.
